NEW UPDATE for AVEdge HUB & SE build. ***v18.5.16, updated 16-May-2018***

Fixed and enhanced the functionality of LIVE channels to load more easily. 
There's now over 2100 channels in LIVE on the main menu, thanks to Fluxux.
Added our brand new addon to give more live TV channels. Go to APPS and 
look for the MKcanlive video addon. We're still building our channel lists 
for that addon, but the US TV list is up and running. Try it out.
