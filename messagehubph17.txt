NEW UPDATE for AVEdge HUB build. ***v18.4.15, updated 15-Apr-2018***
Hey loyal AVEdge HUB users, if you haven't updated your AVEdge HUB lately,
do it now. We've added more live TV options and movie and TV show plugins.
Click on LIVE on the main menu for hundreds of TV channels. The LIVE sub-menu 
has Rising Tide for UK, USA and other channels from around the world and we 
added a link to CBC Toronto, Global Toronto and CBC News! And check out 
Fluxus Cinema in the MOVIES section for movies going back to the 1920's.
