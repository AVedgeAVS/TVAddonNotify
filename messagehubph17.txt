NEW UPDATE for AVEdge HUB build. ***v18.4.25, updated 25-Apr-2018***
Changed MOVIES and SHOWS to use Neptune. Works fast, try it out.
Changed ADULT add-on. Code remains the same.
Minor menu changes.
If you haven't yet, try Fluxus Cinema under MOVIES, and Rising Tide under 
Live TV. These are working great.
