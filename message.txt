Hello from AVEdge. There's been lots of changes in the community and as promised we 
will always work hard to keep the app fresh. We say good bye to Phoenix and One242415 
and say hello to Arawak TV and Zen. The lastest version is v5.5.0, updated 11-Jun-2017. 

To check your current version; inside AVEdge HUB, go to SYSTEM, then scroll down to 
SERVICES and check the DEVICE NAME.

To get the latest update: First quit the AVEdge HUB app, then open the App Draw and 
click on the AVEdge Updater app. Click 'Continue', then choose AVEdge HUB Build, click 
'I Agree' and wait for the new version to download and install.
