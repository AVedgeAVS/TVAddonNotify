Hello again from your friends at AVEdge. 

We've been hard at work making AVEdge HUB even better. We now have hundreds of live TV channels available. To enable the Live channels:
1) Click on SETTINGS on the Main menu. 
2) Go down to PVR SERVICES and click on it. This brings up the GENERAL menu.
3) Click the radio button on the top line that says ENABLED.
4) Wait about 3-5 minutes to load all the channels and program guides.
5) Go back to LIVE TV on the Main menu and click the down arrow, then click IPTV CHANNELS.

Latest update is 09-Nov-2016, version v2.8.1.

Thank you for choosing AVEdge and the AVEdge HUB Build. Happy streaming.
