AVEdge ANX has a new update. The lastest version is v4.1.0, updated 16-Jun-2017.
Sadly, Phoenix and ONE242415 are no longer. But we've added more live TV in 
Arawak TV, streaming lots of Caribbean and African TV. Check it out under LIVE TV. 

To check your current version; inside AVEdge ANX, go to SYSTEM, then scroll down to 
SERVICES and check the DEVICE NAME.

To get the latest update: First quit out of AVEdge SE, then open the App draw and 
click on AVEdge Updater SE. Click 'I Agree' and wait for the new version to 
download and install. Allow any Add-on updates to complete before streaming.
