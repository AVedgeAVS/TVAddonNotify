Hello from your friends at AVEdge. We've given our AVEdge SE a major facelift. We hope you like it.

The lastest version is v10, updated 31-Jan-2017.
- Added the LIVE TV section to the Main Menu. You'll find lots of Live TV add-ons in there, including
  a 'Canada IPTV' add-on for Canadian live channels. Try it out.
- For those of you looking for the Adult section:
  (1) Go to SYSTEM and go down to the submenu and click on 'Skin Settings'
  (2) At the top right of the screen click on 'Set up Aeon Nox Main Menu'
  (3) Now on the left side scroll down to ADULT 18+ ONLY and then click on 'Enable' on the top right 
      side of the screen. The Adult section will now appear on the Main Menu.
